# Full Stack REST CRUD App

This project is a **full-stack web application** built using **Spring Boot** for the backend and **Angular** for the frontend. It implements a **complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system** with structured multi-layer architecture.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

### Backend (Spring Boot)
- **Spring Boot** – Handles business logic and data processing.  
- **Spring MVC** – Manages API requests through **Controller, Service, and DAO layers**.  
- **Spring Data JPA** – Interacts with the database.  
- **Exception Handling** – Provides clean and meaningful error responses.  

### Frontend (Angular)
- **Angular** – Builds a dynamic and interactive UI.  
- **HTTPClient** – Communicates with the Spring Boot API.  
- **Bootstrap** – Enhances UI styling.  

## 📌 Features
✅ Full **CRUD** operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).  
✅ **Multi-layered architecture** (Controller → Service → DAO).  
✅ **Exception Handling** for better error management.  
✅ **REST API** communication between frontend and backend.  
✅ **Responsive UI** built with Angular.  

## 💡 What I Learned
